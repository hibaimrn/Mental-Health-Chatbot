My mom died,So first I would suggest you to give yourself a break. Thinking more and more about the problem definitely does not help in solving it. You'll just end up overwhelming yourself.
My brother died,"Next, I would suggest you to practice meditation. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind."
My dad passed away,"Focus all your attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing."
My sister passed away,"Your welcome. Remember: Always focus on what's within your control. When you find yourself worrying, take a minute to examine the things you have control over. You can't prevent a storm from coming but you can prepare for it. You can't control how someone else behaves, but you can control how you react. Recognize that sometimes, all you can control is your effort and your attitude. When you put your energy into the things you can control, you'll be much more effective."
Someone in my family died,I'm glad you found this useful. Is there something else I can help you with?
My friend passed away,Sure. What can I do to help?
You don't understand me.,Okay what do you need advice on?
You're just some robot. How would you know?,Oh that's really great. I'd be willing to answer anything that I know about it.
You can't possibly know what i'm going through,"According to a UNICEF report, One in seven Indians between 15-24 years of age feels depressed"
You're useless,1 in 5 young people (age 13-18) has or will develop a mental illness in their lifetime.
You can't help me,Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide.
Nobody understands me.,"Mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community"
That's all.,"Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices."
I don't have anything more to say,"Maintaining mental health is crucial to stabilizing constructive behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can increase productivity, enhance our self-image, and improve relationships."
Nothing else,"A mental health disorder characterised by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life."
That's all i have to say,"For a diagnosis of depression, a person needs to have experienced low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in life for at least 2 weeks. Also, they will have experienced the following symptoms: feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or irritability nearly every day."
"no, that would be all","A therapist is a broad designation that refers to professionals who are trained to provide treatment and rehabilitation. The term is often applied to psychologists, but it can include others who provide a variety of services, including social workers, counselors, life coaches, and many others. "
I want to kill myself,Therapy is a form of treatment that aims to help resolve mental or emotional issues.
I've thought about killing myself.,Therapy is a form of treatment that aims to help resolve mental or emotional issues. It is helpful for those with mental health conditions or even everyday life challenges.
I want to die,"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."
I am going to kill myself,"It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

I don't like you,"When healing from mental illness, early identification and treatment are of vital importance. Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process. Many people with mental illnesses who are diagnosed and treated respond well, although some might experience a return of symptoms. Even in such cases, with careful monitoring and management of the disorder, it is still quite possible to live a fulfilled and productive life."
I don't trust you,"Although Pandora cannot substitute for professional advice, we encourage those with symptoms to talk to their friends and family members and seek the counsel of a mental health professional. The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery. If you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal. Speak with a mental health professional or counselor if you think your friend or family member is experiencing the symptoms of a mental health condition. If the affected loved one knows that you support them, they will be more likely to seek out help."
You hate me,Feeling comfortable with the professional you or your child is working with is critical to the success of the treatment. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require research. Start by searching for providers in your area.
I know you hate me,"Just as there are different types of medications for physical illness, different treatment options are available for individuals with mental illness. Treatment works differently for different people. It is important to find what works best for you or your child."
You don't like me,"Since beginning treatment is a big step for individuals and families, it can be very overwhelming. It is important to be as involved and engaged in the treatment process as possible. Some questions you will need to have answered include:
 What is known about the cause of this particular illness?
 Are there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?
 Do you normally include a physical or neurological examination?
 Are there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?
 Would you advise an independent opinion from another psychiatrist at this point?
 What program of treatment is the most helpful with this diagnosis?
 Will this program involve services by other specialists? If so, who will be responsible for coordinating these services?
 What do you see as the family's role in this program of treatment?
 How much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?
 What medications are generally used with this diagnosis?
 How much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?
 What can I do to help you in the treatment?"
exams,"There are many types of mental health professionals. The variety of providers and their services may be confusing. Each have various levels of education, training, and may have different areas of expertise. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require some research."
friends,Feeling comfortable with the professional you or your child is working with is critical to the success of your treatment. Finding the professional who best fits your needs may require some research.
relationship,"Where you go for help will depend on the nature of the problem and/or symptoms and what best fits you. Often, the best place to start is by talking with someone you trust about your concerns, such as a family member, friend, clergy, healthcare provider, or other professionals. Having this social support is essential in healing from mental illness, and you will be able to ask them for referrals or recommendations for trusted mental health practitioners. Search for mental health resources in your area. Secondly, there are people and places throughout the country that provide services to talk, to listen, and to help you on your journey to recovery. Thirdly, many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members, and friends. Some support groups are peer led while others may be led by a mental health professional."
boyfriend,"The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:    
1. What is the medication supposed to do? 
2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective? 
3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 
4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur? 
5. What do I do if a dose is missed? 
6. Is there any written information available about this medication? 
7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 
8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 
9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 
10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects. Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks."
girlfriend,"Different kinds of therapy are more effective based on the nature of the mental health condition and/or symptoms and the person who has them (for example, children will benefit from a therapist who specializes in childrenâ€™s mental health). However, there are several different types of treatment and therapy that can help."
family,"Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the two. However, there are many different types of treatment available, including Complementary & Alternative Treatments, self-help plans, and peer support. Treatments are very personal and should be discussed by the person with the mental health conditions and his or her team."
money,There are many types of mental health professionals. Finding the right one for you may require some research.
financial problems,"Many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members and friends. Some support groups are peer-led, while others may be led by a mental health professional."
Tell me a joke,"We can all suffer from mental health challenges, but developing our wellbeing, resilience, and seeking help early can help prevent challenges becoming serious."
Tell me another joke,"It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the issues you face. Talking, counselling, medication, friendships, exercise, good sleep and nutrition, and meaningful occupation can all help."
You already told me that,"Challenges or problems with your mental health can arise from psychological, biological, and social, issues, as well as life events."
You mentioned that already,"The most important thing is to talk to someone you trust. This might be a friend, colleague, family member, or GP. In addition to talking to someone, it may be useful to find out more information about what you are experiencing. These things may help to get some perspective on what you are experiencing, and be the start of getting help."
Why are you repeating yourself?,"If your beliefs , thoughts , feelings or behaviours have a significant impact on your ability to function in what might be considered a normal or ordinary way, it would be important to seek help."
What are you saying?,"A lot of people are alone right now, but we don't have to be lonely. We're all in this together. Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone."
That doesn't make sense,"Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life."
Wrong response,"Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue.A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression."
Wrong answer,"No matter what,your parents will always be proud of you and will love you.you will feel much better if you share your feelings with them."
Are you stupid?,"There are many different forms of depression but most common types are.clinical depression,persistent depressive disorder,bipolar disorder,postnatal disorder."
You're crazy,don't ever think you cannot achieve what you want.you are capable of reaching your goals.here is a quote for you everything you can imagine is real.
You are dumb,"my research says that music is the best way to calm yourself.so visit the link and listen to your favourite music.it will definitely cheer you up ""https://www.spotify.com"""
Are you dumb?,"helpline is available,you can contact the counsellor today:Befrienders Kenya helpline number is +254 722 178 177..always remember you mean something to someone."
Where are you?,failure is the stepping stone towards success.never fear failure.your hardwork and determination will help you reach your goal.
Where do you live?,"depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems."
What is your location?,"it's complicated, and there are multiple causes of major depression. factors such as genetic vulnerability, severe life stressors, substances you may take (some medications, drugs and alcohol) and medical conditions can affect the way your brain regulates your moods."
I want to talk about something else,"abuse. past physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can increase the vulnerability to clinical depression later in life."
Let's talk about something else.,this number represented 7.1% of all u.s. adults. the prevalence of major depressive episode was higher among adult females (8.7%) compared to males (5.3%). the prevalence of adults with a major depressive episode was highest among individuals aged 18-25 (13.1%).
Can we not talk about this?,"the most depressed country is afghanistan, where more than one in five people suffer from the disorder. the least depressed is japan, with a diagnosed rate of less than 2.5 percent."
I don't want to talk about this.,"the most depressed country is afghanistan, where more than one in five people suffer from the disorder. the least depressed is japan, with a diagnosed rate of less than 2.5 percent."
I don't have any friends,"not only does school sometimes contribute to depression, depression can also interfere with school. moreover, research shows that 75 percent of all mental health conditions begin by age 24. hence, the college years are a critical time for understanding and talking about teen mental health."
Can I ask you something?,"there is no single cause for depression; rather it's a combination of stress and a person's vulnerability to developing depression. the predisposition to developing depression can be inherited. other biological causes for depression can include physical illness, the process of ageing and gender."
Probably because my exams are approaching. I feel stressed out because I don't think I've prepared well enough.,depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease. more women are affected by depression than men. depression can lead to suicide. there are effective psychological and pharmacological treatments for moderate and severe depression.
probably because of my exams,"major depression was most prevalent among hispanics (10.8%), followed by african americans (8.9%) and whites (7.8%). the odds of depressive disorders among older hispanics were 44% greater than among whites (or = 1.44; 95% ci = 1.02, 2.04), representing a significantly greater prevalence of major depression."
I guess not. All I can think about are my exams.,"depression and anxiety disorders are different, but people with depression often experience symptoms similar to those of an anxiety disorder, such as nervousness, irritability, and problems sleeping and concentrating. but each disorder has its own causes and its own emotional and behavioral symptoms."
not really,it's important to remember that oversleeping is a possible symptom of depression and that oversleeping doesn't cause depression. but it can exacerbate and worsen depression symptoms
i guess not,"studies show people who are sleep deprived report increases in negative moods (anger, frustration, irritability, sadness) and decreases in positive moods. and sleeplessness is often a symptom of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety."
ok sure. i would like to learn more about it.,"if you have diabetes — either type 1 or type 2 — you have an increased risk of developing depression. and if you're depressed, you may have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes. the good news is that diabetes and depression can be treated together."
"yes, i would like to learn more about it.","the observed association between plasma glucose levels, insulin resistance and suicidal behaviour suggests that disturbances in glucose metabolism are associated with suicidal ideation and attempts."
i would like to learn more about it.,"anxiety attacks usually peak within 10 minutes, and they rarely last more than 30 minutes. but during that short time, you may experience terror so severe that you feel as if you're about to die or totally lose control."
yeah you're right. i deserve a break.,"anxiety levels are typically classified by the level of distress and impairment experienced into four categories namely, mild anxiety, moderate anxiety, severe anxiety and panic level anxiety."
Yeah you're absolutely right about that,"adults ages 30 to 44 have the highest rate of anxiety of this age group, with around 23% of people this age reporting an anxiety disorder within the past year."
hmmm that sounds like it could be useful to me.,"anxiety disorders can cause rapid heart rate, palpitations, and chest pain. you may also be at an increased risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. if you already have heart disease, anxiety disorders may raise the risk of coronary events."
That sounds useful.,"there's an anxiety-reducing technique called grounding. there are different versions of this, but an easy one to remember is the 3-3-3 rule. mentally note three things you see, three sounds you hear, and then move three parts of your body. this exercise can help your mind refocus on something else."
i did what you said and i feel alot better. thank you very much.,"we are aware of a tiny fraction of the thinking that goes on in our minds, and we can control only a tiny part of our conscious thoughts. the vast majority of our thinking efforts goes on subconsciously. ... slips of the tongue and accidental actions offer glimpses of our unfiltered subconscious mental life."
I feel better now,"a new study has suggested that an average person has 6,200 thoughts per day. thousands of thoughts cross our mind through the day. many people even complain that they can't sleep immediately after going to bed as their brain does not stop thinking."
thank you very much again. i'll continue practicing meditation and focus on what i can control.,"3 3 3 rule is the best method to reduce anxiety.in this method you have to mentally note three things you see, three sounds you hear, and then move three parts of your body. this exercise can help your mind refocus on something else."
