Question,Answer
"1- What is good mental health?
A. Not having a mental illness
B. Feeling good about yourself, others and your environment
C. Doing yoga every day","B :
Mental health is a state, or reflection, of our emotional and mental well-being as it relates to ourselves
(self-esteem), others (friends and family) and our different environments (school, our sports teams and
dance groups, home and virtual environments such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, video games, etc.).
It’s like an inner scale that can tip to one side or the other as we experience the ups and downs of life.
Everyone can take care of their mental health and stay balanced, whether they’ve been diagnosed with a
mental illness or not."
"2- Half of all mental health disorders begin before what age?
A. 14 years of age
B. 6 years of age
C. 22 years of age
An swer A :
Half of all mental health disorders begin before the age of 14, and 75% before the age of 22. That’s why
it’s very important to take care of your mental health, even if you’re young!
3- True or false? You can “work” on your mental health.
A. True
B. False
An swer A :
Good mental health is something you build. You can maintain your mental health with short daily
exercises and good lifestyle habits. This can include sleeping 8 to 10 hours a night, eating healthily,
exercising (even moderately) at least 1 hour a day, managing your screen time, etc. With practice, it gets
easier and easier – just like learning a sport.
4- How can you improve your mental health?
A. Filling your day with activities (sports, school, etc.) without taking a break
B. Looking at photos of fitness or lifestyle influencers and trying to imitate them
C. Spending time with friends and family","C :
Spending time with friends and family! Why should you? Because it’ll do you a world of good to see
people in person and spend time talking or doing something fun together. Conversely, overloading
yourself or comparing yourself to people whose image doesn’t always match reality, such as influencers,
creates stress and anxiety, and undermines your self-esteem.

"35- When you’re feeling stressed or anxious, what’s the best way to ease the pressure?
A. Watch your favourite TV show on repeat
B. Annoy your little brother, friends or your parents
C. Meditate","C :
Meditate! Running away from your problem by doing mindless activities, keeping busy or acting it out
on others only pushes it away and solves nothing. Meditation allows you to take a break from your
thoughts by focusing on the present moment. You’ll be able to reconnect with your emotions and the
sensations in your body, as well as with what’s going on around you."
"6- What clues might alert you that a friend or classmate is in distress?
A. They get angry over nothing and always seem sad
B. They suddenly don’t want to take part in any activities
C. All of the above","C :
All of these answers! These signs are visible manifestations that a person isn’t doing well. When we
experience distress, we don’t act like our normal selves; we are unable to function as before. Our
emotions, behaviour and way of thinking all change – and not for the better. If these changes persist, if
they become intense, if they prevent us from functioning and there are no signs of improvement, it
could be depression."
"7- When you’re fighting with a friend, what’s the best way to act?
A. Take a break to calm down before responding to them
B. Tell them right away what you think of them
C. Wait for them to make the first move – it's their fault, after all!","A :
Take a break to calm down before responding. The time out will give you a chance to think rather than
act impulsively, to understand yourself better, to show more tolerance and openness, and to change
your mind about people and situations."
"8- If a friend or classmate is showing signs of distress, where can you find resources to help?
A. At school, by talking to a Special Education Technician (SET)
B. Outside school, by contacting Tel-Jeunes or speaking with your parents, family or a trustworthy adult,
for example
C. All of the above","C :
All of these answers! There are many resources available at school, outside school and remotely to
answer your questions. So if you, a friend or a classmate is feeling down, don’t wait, ask for help.

"39- True or false? When you don’t feel well, the best course of action is to wait it out.
A. True
B. False","B :
Not true! Did you know that the majority of people who seek help for mental health issues do so
successfully? When you’re feeling down, it’s important to confide in someone you trust and who can
direct you to the right resources if needed."
"10- What is a parasitic thought?
A. A thought that blocks your brain
B. A thought that feeds on another thought
C. A thought that makes us suffer and prevents us from moving forward","C :
A thought that causes you to suffer and prevents you from moving forward. This type of thought is
based on a story that your head tells you. It may be a past situation you’re thinking about or a future
situation you’re anticipating that hasn’t happened yet. Parasitic thinking doesn’t help you find solutions
to problems. Quite the opposite! It tends to drag you down and paralyze you. Conversely, useful
thinking is thinking based on your senses, takes place in the present moment and offers a possible
solution. When you’re sorting out your thoughts, you need to disregard the parasitic thoughts and take
action on the useful ones."
"11- What should you do when you feel stressed?
A. Sort out your thoughts and meditate
B. Talk to yourself the way you’d talk to a friend
C. All of the above","C :
All of these answers! Sorting out your useful thoughts from your parasitic ones, talking to yourself as if
you were a friend and meditating are all great ways to help you manage your stress.
12 - What is self-compassion?
A. Being self-centred
B. Practising positive self-talk
C. Not having compassion for others
Answer B :
Practising positive self-talk. When you’re going through a rough time or facing an obstacle, do you tend
to be overly critical and hard on yourself? Practising positive self-talk means talking to yourself in your
head as if you were talking to your best friend; in other words, with kindness and compassion. Did you
know that the “good ol’ kick in the butt” attitude is rarely effective, nor is it sustainable? Self-compassion
isn’t about being passive or resigned. Rather, it’s all about actively relieving your suffering.
